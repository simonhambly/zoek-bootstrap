      <h1>Pours smooth and creamy into the glass.</h1>
      <p>The beer is an opaque and murky straw-amber color, topped with a thick and creamy foam head. Lacing is nice, with some glass-clinging action going on, and more than ample head retention. What's odd about the appearance is the amount of yeast in suspension. Even when chilled for days, the yeast is still hanging in there, when typically it would settle. Something is keeping it floating around, and it aint Mother Nature.</p>

<h2>Out of the 12-ounce brown bottle</h2>
<p>Leatherlips pours a deep and vibrant golden color that offers up a beautiful clarity, prompting us to leave the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. A good two fingers of head pillow up from a hard pour. Soon after, the scent of hops permeates the nostrils. An old-school aroma of high alpha hops reveals this as an IPA before the first sip: pungent, citric and floral all over the place. Hints of lightly toasted grain in the nose as well. Its smooth mouthfeel and moderate body earn drinkability points. Mild biscuity malt, fruitiness and some yeast up front. This all gets wiped away by a wall of hops. First, the sting of bitterness and then a long-lingering herbal and citric finish.</p>

<p>The final hop impact on aroma was surprisingly subtle, and incredibly pleasing, with a delicate citrus floral and fruity perfume that played with the nose. Flavor-wise, the beer is extremely smooth and creamy on the palate with an even and full body. As the hops hit the taste buds, it runs a bit coarse, with hop tannins, floral, citric, slight aspirin, mild spiciness, and a soft twang of rind that sticks to the palate and hangs in there for quite a while. This segues into pronounced esters and suggestions of sweet blood oranges that meld with a balanced malty sweetness, with grainy and bready notes from Pale and Pilsner malts. As for the bottled version, it was noticeably maltier, sweeter, with more grainy characters. Balance and refinement were pronounced, along with the carbonation due to a variation of CO2 levels between the bottle and keg; the keg version being lower so that publicans can actually pour the beer. The 9 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) in both was well hidden.

<p>This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Georgy Zhukov, arguably one of the finest generals of World War II. Opaque black in color, with notes of espresso, chocolate, dark toffee and hints of backstrap molasses. The English hop varietals provide a subtle herbal dryness, and finishes with a hearty slap of roasty espresso. Pair Marshal Zhukov’s with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia. We brew and release Zhukov's in the summer knowing that a beer of this heft reaches its full potential a few months after release. So save a bottle for the cold winter!</p>

<p>Pours smooth and creamy into the glass. The beer is an opaque and murky straw-amber color, topped with a thick and creamy foam head.

<p>Nose shows some clove and banana bread, with a soft wheat-husk background, nutty yeast, hints of citrus and a brush of floral. In the mouth, the beer is smooth on the palate, light and uplifting. The palate is piqued by crisp carbonation and a watery, lemony edge that segues into a slightly grassy wheat twang, with very soft phenolic image clover-like and thin banana flavors. Pithy floral, nutty yeast, gummy notes. Hops are non-existent, but somewhat expected for the style. Malt characters are weak, lending just a hint of residual sweetness. The finish on this brew is bone dry, with a mouthful of rough and husky tannins and yeast flavors that, unfortunately, linger long past their welcome.</p>

<p>Very smooth on the palate with a creamy carbonation buildup, seltzery feel and tonic-water bite. This is followed by a quick and sharp tannic tartness that oddly lingers in the background and into the finish. Layered on top of this is something quite sweet, but not cloying, with a rosewater-like base, notes of strawberries, faint berry-like sourness, white grapes, orange pith, floral honey, over-ripe peach meat, pear juice, hints of mint, and a cutting peppery edge that segues into a somewhat-spicy and increasingly warming booziness, thanks to its 8 percent alcohol by volume. Pleasingly herbal, akin to sweetened cold Chinese tea. Light tannins linger in the bone-dry, powdery finish.</p>

<p>The beer pours hazed amber, topped with a very tightly laced creamy head. This traps some biscuity tannin aromas for the nose, framed with floral and wood. Very smooth upfront, and a bit creamy in mouthfeel. The malty body flexes with a full and even bready sweetness and doughy and soapy edges. A citric bite throws down on the taste buds with some herbal spice, flower pith, leaf, and some oily stick, with piney notes. Loads of fruit presence, like a fruit mélange of blood orange and grapefruit steeped in a rose-hip peel tea-like character. An aggressive spicy alcohol presence waits beneath, hitting the head with a warming sensation that targets the forehead region and numbness forming in the temples. A deep oak flavor comes about towards the finish, and especially throughout as the beer warms. A very distinct and subdued dry and semi-tangy flavor that is pulled from the oak and is a bit vinous at times, layers this beer with much depth. Suggestions of vanilla as the beer warms, with hints of brown sugar sweetness. Bready and soapy lingers.</p>

<p>A Belgian Quad by recipe, but aging it in spirits barrels garners its own category: Central Coast Quad. A beer formulated to sit on the sweeter and malty side so that we could utilize it for blending. Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico adds wonderful molasses flavors that are reminiscent of Belgian candi sugar. It has a full body and lush texture with barrel expression all over this beer: toasted oak, coconut, leather and cigar tobacco.</p>

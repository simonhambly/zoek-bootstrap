#### Different actions

By default buttons are secondary actions, use the primary action (sparingly) to highlight certain actions, typically 'calls to action'.

For 'application type behviour' e.g. add/save/remove consider using 'application' buttons

Note: button text is automatically set to sentence case for readability â€” do not override this.
